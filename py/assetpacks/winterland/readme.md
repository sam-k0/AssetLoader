## Winterland (Christmas Hero)

The Lich has cast the world into an eternal winter storm, plunging its inhabitants into a never ending chaos. Wield a growing deck of enchanted cards to place mischievous foes, festive buildings, and snowy landscapes along each unique expedition loop for the christmas saving hero.

# Ready-to-Install Mod

Download [this](https://github.com/sam-k0/AssetLoader/releases/download/pack-2025.09.26/Winterland.Pack.zip) zip archive and extract it into your game folder. (The folder that contains `LoopHero.exe`)

### What does this archive include?
- Winterland assets (Assets folder)
- AssetLoader mod (AssetLoader.dll)
- Loop Hero Core mod (LoopHeroCallbackCore.dll)
- Modloader (dinput8.dll)

### How to uninstall
Simply delete the extracted files.
All of the Loop Hero modding that I do does not modify any of the original game files, so uninstalling is as easy as deleting the files.
